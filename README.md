# Part 1:
In this project the author will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. The author will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials with a thousand simulations.

# Part 2
Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

1.Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
2.Provide a basic summary of the data.
3.Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
